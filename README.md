# Bujo App

This app was built with Tauri and the work of [bulletjournal](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/bulletjournal). I've added the ability for saving data onto the file system.

# Shortcuts

Loading and saving data, are all manual processes for now with shortcuts.

- metakey+, select folder where the data will live. It is advisable to use a directory in a cloud drive.
- metakey+s, save current data
- metakey+l, load current data

# Tauri + Vanilla

This app was built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.
